weibo_cputemp
=============

This is a small project for sending cpu temperature to weibo.com

1. Require
  1) Open Hardware Monitor
     The Open Hardware Monitor is a free open source software that monitors
     temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load and clock speeds of a
     computer. It can be download from:

     http://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/

     But I recommend to check out source code from googlecode.com

     svn checkout http://open-hardware-monitor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-hardware-monitor-read-only
